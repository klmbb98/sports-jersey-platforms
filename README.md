## FAQ

**How long does custom jersey production typically take?**

Most platforms require 2-4 weeks for standard production, with rush options available for faster delivery at additional cost. Sublimated uniforms from some providers ship in as little as 3-5 days, while complex custom designs or embroidery work may take longer. Always confirm turnaround times before ordering if you're working against a deadline, and factor in shipping time to your location.

**Can I order just a few jerseys or do platforms require minimums?**

Several platforms including Wooter, SquadLocker, and Sports Gear Swag explicitly state no minimum orders, letting you purchase individual jerseys or small quantities. Others may have minimums depending on decoration methods—sublimation typically allows smaller runs than traditional screen printing. Check each platform's policies for your specific sport and customization needs.

**What's included in the base price versus extra charges?**

Platform pricing varies significantly—some include all customization elements like logos, names, numbers, and colors in one flat price, while others charge per addition. Common upcharges include player names ($5-6 per jersey), special colors, rush production (15-50% premium), and certain decoration methods. Always review the full price breakdown including any per-player personalization costs before finalizing designs.
